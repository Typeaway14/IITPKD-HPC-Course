Speaker for the day: [Satyajit Das](https://iitpkd.ac.in/people/satyajitdas)

> Note: Refer to notes provided in [Prof_notes](./Prof_notes) for content. 

## Day 1:
 
- ```Time = Instruction/Program + Clocks Per Instruction + Time per Cycle```
- Amdahl's Law
- Gustafson's Law
- Hardware Acceleration:
- What hardware can be used?
    - GPU, TPU, FPGA, CGRA
- Why?
    - General Purpose Processors are inefficient, and so are high level languages.
    - Solution: Domain Specific Architecture(DSA) and Domain Specific Languages(DSL) 
- Parallelism important for acceleration
- SIMD processing
    - Array Processor
    - Vector Processor
- Mentioned about Intel MMX and Cerebras' Wafer Scale Engine
- MIMD 
- SIMT
- Fine and Coarse Grained Multithreading

## Day 2:

### Fundamentals to AI

- Models targeted to think, perceive and perform some actions
- 2 Views to AI:
    - AI Tools
    - AI Agents
- Birth of the idea:
    - Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it
- Paradigms:
    - Modelling
    - Learning
    - Inference

### Fundamentals to ML

- Various models of ML:
    - Reflex Based Learning
    - State Based models
    - Variable Based Models
    - Logic Models


### Fundamentals to Deep Learning

- McColloch Pitts Neuron
- Perceptrons
- Multilayer Perceptrons
- Activation Functions
- Feedforward Neural Networks
- Gradient Descent
- Backpropagation
- Convolution Neural Networks
- Maxpooling
- ML Based Vision
    - Static feature Extraction
